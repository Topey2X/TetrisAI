    <h2>What is Tetris</h2>
    <p>Tetris is a classic tile matching video game created in 1984 where geometric shapes composed of four square blocks known as tetriminos fall from the top of the playing field of which there are 7 different types. Players must rotate and move these blocks to complete a line. When a line is complete it disappears and any blocks above get shifted down. The game ends when the stack of tetriminos reaches the top of the playing field. Essentially more lines you clear the bigger your score. </p>
    <p>Our model will look to reward good moves and penalise bad ones.</p>
    
    <h2>What are good and bad moves</h2>
    <p>Good moves include completing lines specifically more than one at a time, minimising the risk of creating a hole. </p>
    <p>A good move that would be considered advanced specifically for an AI would be setting up the ability to clear multiple lines such as leaving a gap for a line piece so as to complete a tetris, when you clear four lines at once, this also rewards you with the most amount of points.</p>
    <p>On the other hand bad moves are ones that create gaps and not rotating for optimal block placement.</p>

    <h2>The Tetriminos</h2>
    <p>There are 7 tetriminos in tetris. Each denoted by the letter they most resemble. These are [I,J,L,O,S,T,Z].</p>

    <h2>Our AI</h2>
    <p>Our AI, the tetris master 3000 uses DQN and reinforcment learning to train our model and play the game. Below you can see our AI Training on the left side and playing on the right.</p>
    <p>Our objective is for a given state, calculate the expected final reward. The game is run by providing the AI with all possible final states for the next block, and then the best state is chosen by the AI.</p>
    <p>More infromation regarding the AI is available on other pages such as the environment page.</p>
    <p>The benefits of using a model like us where we calculate the best expected final reward compared to that which tries to calculate the best move (rotating, move, drop) for the current board state is:</p>
    <ul class="reward-list"> 
        <li>The AI can 'plan' for better scores such as aiming for a tetris.</li>
        <li>The AI does not need to know which new block has been added, as the observation is of the final state.</li>
        <li>The Input space can be metadata about the game board, instead of the actual game board, allowing for (1) smaller input space, and (2) more nuanced control over what the AI is optimising for.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Playing on different sized tetris boards</h2>
    <p>A benefit of our AI being provided all possible moves and getting it to select the best one is we are able to change the size of the tetris game and using the same trained data get insanly high scores still. The video below shows our AI playing on a 30 x 20 tetris board however it is using the same training as the video above where it was trained on a 10 x 20 board. </p>
