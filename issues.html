    <h2>Overfitting</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%;">Our current largest issue is the fact that our AI loves going for tetris' more than surviving. This can and will be tweaked in regards to the rewards. This issue can be seen in the below image where it ends the game rather than placing previous pieces and the line piece to continue.</p>

    <h2>Leaving holes</h2>
    <p>Our AI still leaves occasional holes when playing however this may just be the optimum move.</p>

    <h2>Skill Shots</h2>
    <p>Our AI does not have the ability to do skill shots such as rotating a piece into place or sliding a piece under another piece which limits its ability in many cases and would probably lead to some of the leaving holes issues.</p>

    <h2>Training Time</h2>
    <p>A good problem to have is our training is taking longer and longer as we get a better model and games last longer the training time is greatly increased.</p>
